# Changelog v2.0.1

Version 2.0.1 of CLAVIN includes some restructuring of the API, adds some new functionality, and offers some minor performance-enhancing tweaks to the core resolution algorithm.

This list details most of the major and minor changes made in CLAVIN v2.0.1:

- made CLAVIN ancestry loading configurable, defaulting to lazy loading to boost performance.
- fixed the TravisCI build script to account for the necessary build time of the index for passing tests 

Configuration of ancestry loading has yielded an improvement to performance.
